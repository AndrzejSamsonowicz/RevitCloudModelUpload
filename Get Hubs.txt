GET	hubs
Returns a collection of accessible hubs for this member.

Hubs represent BIM 360 Team hubs, Fusion Team hubs (formerly known as A360 Team hubs), A360 Personal hubs, or BIM 360 Docs accounts. Team hubs include BIM 360 Team hubs and Fusion Team hubs (formerly known as A360 Team hubs). Personal hubs include A360 Personal hubs. Only active hubs are listed.

Note that for BIM 360 Docs, a hub ID corresponds to an account ID in the BIM 360 API. To convert an account ID into a hub ID you need to add a "b." prefix. For example, an account ID of c8b0c73d-3ae9 translates to a hub ID of b.c8b0c73d-3ae9.
